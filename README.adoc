= jRxTx - Java Serial Communication Library

jRxTx is a Java serial communication library licensed under the
LGPLv2.1 or later + linking exception. It can be used to communicate
using well known UART-based serial protocols such as RS-232, RS-422
and RS-485. The goal of jRxTx is to provide a lightweight, intuitive
and well documented API.

jRxTx wraps the popular http://rxtx.qbang.org/[RXTX] library for which
development has been discontinued. jRxTx provides two kinds of APIs:
1) the original RXTX API and 2) a new improved API.


== Original RXTX API

jRxTx can be used as a drop-in replacement for RXTX. The wrapped RXTX
has some advantages compared to the last RXTX release (version
2.2pre2):

* It includes several bug fixes that do NOT change its API though

* The jar file is an OSGi Bundle

* The jar file is published on
  https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22jrxtx%22[maven
  central].

* The Java build system is based on Gradle. This way it is easy to add
  the native libs to the jar.

https://openmuc.github.io/jrxtx/javadoc/index.html.

== New jRxTx API

In addition to the original RXTX API jRxTx provides a new API with the
following advantages:

The InputStream implementation provided by the original RXTX violates
the contract of the general java.io.InputStream interface. It has the
following two problems:
    
* A timeout does not throw an exception but instead returns -1. But
  according to the InputStream interface -1 should only be returned if
  the stream is closed (i.e. the end of stream is reached).

* A thread blocking in InputStream.read() cannot be interrupted by
  closing the associated serial port. Trying to close the serial port
  while another thread is blocking in read() causes the close()
  function to block as well.

jRxTx provides an InputStream implementation that conforms to the
java.io.InputStream interface and behaves very similarly to the stream
provided by java.net.Socket used for IP communication.
    
The event listener available in RXTX was removed in jRxTx because it
is not needed for data stream reading.
        
== Java and Native Parts

jRxTx consists of a Java library and a native library written in
C. The Java library calls the native library through JNI. The Java
library (jrxtx-<version>.jar) is published on
https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22jrxtx%22[maven
central]. As published on maven central the Java jar file does not
include the native library.

While the Java library is platform independent, the native part of
jRxTx needs to be compiled separately for different processor
architectures and operating systems. Because of the large variety of
platforms jRxTx does not ship with any precompiled native libs.

The jRxTx java library is compatible with the original RXTX native
library. Thus you can also use the old RXTX native library or the
native library of other RXTX compatible projects such as NRJavaSerial.

You have two options to use the native library:

. You can install the native library so that the Java virtual machine
  can find it.

. You can rebuild the jrxtx jar file to include the native library of
  your choice.

The Java library first searches a native library inside the jar
file. If no compatible lib can be found it tries to load the libary
from the _java.library.path_ (e.g. /usr/lib/jni).

== Installation
    
=== Linux
    
The jRxTx native library is compatible to the RXTX native
library. Therefore on Debian based distributions all you have to do is
install the package ‘librxtx-java’:

----
$ sudo apt-get install librxtx-java
----

This will install the correct native library in
_/usr/lib/jni_. Sometimes you might have to add a system property so
that the JVM finds it: -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni .

The serial ports /dev/tty* are only accessible to members belonging to
groups dialout and tty. You therefore have to add your user to those
groups. E.g. using:

----
sudo adduser <yourUserName> dialout

sudo adduser <yourUserName> tty
----
    
Afterwards you have to log out and log back in in order for the group
changes to become active.
        

=== Windows

On Windows you need to copy the native library of RXTX for your
specific system to the folder that is in the java.libary.path. To
figure out the actual Java library path in your system, you can write
a Java program that prints System.getProperty(‘java.library.path’).

You can get the native library either from the last official RXTX
distribution
https://www.openmuc.org/fileadmin/user_upload/rxtx/rxtx-2.2pre2-bins.zip[rxtx-2.2pre2-bins.zip]
or you can compile it on your own from the source code.

== Compile jRxTx

=== Linux

To compile the jRxTx Java library run the following command:

----
$ ./gradlew clean build
----

The resulting jar can be found in _build/libs_.

To rebuild the native library on Linux enter the folder _native_. Then run:

----
$ ./BUILD.sh
----

The compiled library (librxtxSerial.so) can be found in the _.libs/_ folder.

Once you have compiled the native library you install it so that the
JVM can find and load it. Alternatively you can compile the jar with
the native lib included:

----
$ ./gradlew clean buildWithNative
----

This will create the jar file and include any librxtxSerial.so/.dll
file found in the _native_ folder. A jar file created this way can
load the native library from the jar.
