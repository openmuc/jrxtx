    RXTX License v 2.1 - LGPL v 2.1 + Linking Over Controlled Interface.
    RXTX is a native interface to serial ports in java.
    Copyright 1997-2007 by Trent Jarvi tjarvi@qbang.org and others who
    actually wrote it.  See individual source files for more information.
    . 
    A copy of the LGPL v 2.1 may be found at
    http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt on March 4th 2007.  A copy is
    here for your convenience.

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.
    . 
    An executable that contains no derivative of any portion of RXTX, but
    is designed to work with RXTX by being dynamically linked with it,
    is considered a "work that uses the Library" subject to the terms and
    conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
    . 
    The following has been added to the RXTX License to remove
    any confusion about linking to RXTX.   We want to allow in part what
    section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special
    case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a
    Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the 
    future as another exception but one is not currently available.
    . 
    http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingOverControlledInterface
    . 
    As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you
    permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with
    RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,
    regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy
    and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
    provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
    copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the
    combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
    Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a
    module which is not derived from or based on RXTX.
    .
    Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated
    to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
    their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License
    gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
    exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
    carries forward this exception.
