Subject: Patch to fix setting USB-serial adapters to 38400 bps
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/740098
Forwarded: no
Description: The following patch should fix the reported issue.
 .
 On serial ports not supporting the TIOCGSERIAL/TIOCSSERIAL mechanism,
 this still means that the custom baud rates do not work, but at least
 38400 works, again.
 .
 Perhaps an even better fix would be switching to the newer termios2 API,
 as described here:
 https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2012-October/633871.html
 .
 That API allows setting custom baud rates on the USB serial adapters I
 have tested, where TIOCGSERIAL/TIOCSSERIAL was not supported.
 .
 But unfortunately, termios2 is not available through glibc, so one would
 need to call linux-specific ioctls directly, which wouldn't be portable
 at all, and I don't know how it interacts with the BSD / Hurd ports.
 .
 Therefore this is the minimal fix, for now.
