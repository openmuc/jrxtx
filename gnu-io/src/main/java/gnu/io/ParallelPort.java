|   is considered a "work that uses the Library" subject to the terms and

|
|   The following has been added to the RXTX License to remove
|   any confusion about linking to RXTX.   We want to allow in part what
|   section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special
|   case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a
|   Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the 
|   future as another exception but one is not currently available.

|   As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you
|   permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with
|   RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,
|   regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy
|   and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
|   provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
|   copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the
|   combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
|   Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a
|   module which is not derived from or based on RXTX.
|
|   Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated
|   to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
|   their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License
